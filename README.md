# Predict the market by only looking at the previous performance

This work is based on R and is inspired by the stock game you can find in my other files.

The original was in Rmarkdown, but I created a Jupyter Notebook version as well, if you want to see the result only, knitted html will be a good choice.

Change the stock_n variable to add ones on your watchlist, maybe your portfolio will beat the market as well! :blush:
